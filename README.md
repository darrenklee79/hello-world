# hello-world
This is my first project, entering the world of data science!
Darren here, and I want to learn PCA 
Updated readme.md

# From CodeCademy 
# Use Git commands to help keep track of changes made to a project:
git init creates a new Git repository
git status inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area
git add adds files from the working directory to the staging area
git diff shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area
git commit permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository
git log shows a list of all previous commits


#Congratulations! You've learned three different ways to backtrack in Git. You can use these skills to undo changes made to your Git project.

Let's take a moment to review the new commands:

git checkout HEAD filename: Discards changes in the working directory.
git reset HEAD filename: Unstages file changes in the staging area.
git reset commit_SHA: Resets to a previous commit in your commit history.
Additionally, you learned a way to add multiple files to the staging area with a single command:

git add filename_1 filename_2
